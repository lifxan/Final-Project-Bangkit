## Project Overview

This interactive dashboard visualizes bike rental data from the Bike Sharing dataset. It provides insights into daily, monthly, and seasonal rental patterns, as well as the influence of factors like weather, holidays, and weekdays.

The dashboard allows users to explore:

- Daily rental trends for casual, registered, and total users.
- Monthly rental variations throughout the year.
- Seasonal rental patterns (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
- The impact of weather conditions on bike rentals.
- Rental differences between weekdays, working days, and holidays.

This project was developed to demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.
